While I was hanging out today with my friends, suddenly, I realized that the github
can be used as a blogging platform. The principle is pretty simple:

* each user already has a github account
* user should create a new repo with name 'blog' (or something like that, but the name of this
  repository must be the same for each user, so users can easily and intuitively navigate
  through the service)
* creation of a new post is equal to the creation of a new issue in the 'blog' repository
* to subscribe on the user's blog you just need to click on a 'watch' button inside 'blog' repository

That's it! You can post your staff, comment on it, subscribe to other users. WoooHooo!
