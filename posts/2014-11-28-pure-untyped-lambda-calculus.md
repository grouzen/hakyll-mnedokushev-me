description: Gist-based post about playing with untyped lambda calculus using my own LISP 1.5 interpreter

During reading TaPL book I was uncomfortable to keep in mind all of those complex λ
combinators, and after a while I realized that I have a computer right in front of me!
I was thinking about how it would be great to have some repl which can handle simple
λ expressions. By coincidence, I have one - my old toy LISP 1.5 interpreter written in C [fflisp](http://github.com/grouzen/fflisp).
So, let's start playing...
