    organizations of civil initiative. The most challenging projects in which I've
    participated during my work in the company:  
    1. Bunch of websites that were just a small part of a much bigger government
       project (Russian E-government project), they were entirely written in Oracle PL/SQL
       with a team of professional DBAs in the core.  
       2. Jewerly catalog website with a sofisticated admin panel which allows easily to build
       a catalog of items using drag&drop and some other standard UI/UX methods. Items
       consist of media (image, video, 360° animation) and various GUI elements entirely
       configurable by user. Both client and admin parts were implemented as SPAs
       (single page applications) and were able to work and look correctly in a big number of
