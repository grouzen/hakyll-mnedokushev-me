title: Todo List
--------------------

# Pub&lambda;ic Todo &lambda;ist

Here I'll keep my global public Todo list for the next few month (actually for the next gazillion years XD)
The main goal to do it - motivate myself to get things done! I'll really appreciate your comments with useful links below.
The secondary goal is to keep the list of books and other wonderful stuff that I've ever read.
I would like to update information on this page more often (thus, it would mean I'm moving forward ;-). So, please, feel free to kick my lazy ass!

*I wish you will find it interesting. Enjoy!*

The further links and information devided by topics:

- Computer Science
    - *|Todo|* [Computational Category Theory](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/categories/book/book.pdf)  
      Just an another attempt to dive into the depths of the deepest depths.
      I was shocked that I've found this book on my laptop (the file was downloaded on 23 august 2013).
    - *|Todo|* [Dependently Typed Programming in Agda](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf)  
      I've been frightened to learn languages with dependent types for a long time, but I'm inspired to learn math now.
      So I'm wondering, why don't I send my energy in this direction?
    - *|Todo|* [Brutal Meta Introduction to Dependent Types in Agda](http://oxij.org/note/BrutalDepTypes/)  
      The next thing to read after the previous book.
    - *|In progress|* [Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne - Algorithms, 4th edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)  
      I need to refresh my knowledge about classical data structures and algorithms. Moreover, I even have the [github repository](https://github.com/grouzen/coursera-algorithms) for this, of course I'm using Haskell ;)
- Mathematics
    - *|In progress|* [Infinitesimal Calculus](http://www.amazon.com/Infinitesimal-Calculus-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486428869)  
    I think the nicest book in the world about introduction into calculus in general.
    - *|In progress|* [The geometry of the complex numbers, quoternions, and spins](http://www.mccme.ru/free-books/izdano/2002/VIA-kvatern.pdf)  
    Another one great book from the russian mathematician (badly only in russian). I can read and understand only the first half of the book, but I'm not giving up ;)
- **The list isn't complete yet...**
