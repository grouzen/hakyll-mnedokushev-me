# Pub&lambda;ic Todo Reading &lambda;ist

<i>
Here I'll keep my global public "Todo Reading list" for the next few months/years/lifes/whatever (actually for the next gazillion years XD)
The main goal to do it is to motivate myself to get things done! I'll really appreciate your comments with useful links below.
The secondary goal is to keep the list of books and other wonderful stuff that I've ever read.
I would like to update information on this page more often (thus, it would mean I'm moving forward ;-). So, please, feel free to kick my lazy ass!

*I wish you will find it interesting. Enjoy!*

*January 2015*

The further links and information devided by topics:

- Computer Science
    - General
        - *|Idle|* [Types and Programming Languages](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)  
          The book contains a lot of useful information about types which I personally need for a practical usage.
          The posts about this book can be found by tag [tapl](/tags/tapl.html)
        - *|Idle|* [Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne - Algorithms, 4th edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)  
          I need to refresh my knowledge about classical data structures and algorithms. Moreover, I even have the [github repository](https://github.com/grouzen/coursera-algorithms) for this, of course I'm using Haskell ;)
        - *|Todo|* [Computational Category Theory](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/categories/book/book.pdf)  
          Just an another attempt to dive into the depths of the deepest depths.
          I was shocked that I've found this book on my laptop (the file was downloaded on 23 august 2013).
    - Programming with Dependend Types
        - *|Idle|* [Dependently Typed Programming in Agda](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf)  
          I've been frightened to learn languages with dependent types for a long time, but I'm inspired to learn math now.
          So I'm wondering, why don't I send my energy in this direction?
        - *|Todo|* [Agda Tutorial](http://people.inf.elte.hu/divip/AgdaTutorial/Index.html)  
          Short and clear tutorial without typical blah-blah-bla crap. 
        - *|Todo|* [Brutal Meta Introduction to Dependent Types in Agda](http://oxij.org/note/BrutalDepTypes/)  
          The next thing to read after the previous book.
        
- Math
    - *|Idle (need additional reading)|* [Infinitesimal Calculus](http://www.amazon.com/Infinitesimal-Calculus-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486428869)  
      I think the nicest book in the world about introduction into calculus in general.
    - *|Half Done ;)|* [The geometry of the complex numbers, quoternions, and spins](http://www.mccme.ru/free-books/izdano/2002/VIA-kvatern.pdf)  
      Another one great book from the russian mathematician (badly only in russian). I can read and understand only the first half of the book, but I'm not giving up ;)

- Engineering
    - *|Todo|* [Crypto101](https://www.crypto101.io/)  
      Crypto 101 is an introductory course on cryptography, freely available for programmers of all ages and skill levels.
