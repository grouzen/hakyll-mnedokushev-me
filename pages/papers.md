# Papers I ♥

<i>
On this page I'll store some papers which were usefull for me or gave me the unforgettable and exciting hours of reading them.
</i>
- [LISP 1.5 Programmer's manual](http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/129874/37a4142032912cebb0e8fe8f61c6fe2f.pdf?sequence=1)
  The most significant paper in the history of computer languages and CS. I've read this lovely peace of art many years ago, and the next day
  after that I've started to write [fflisp](https://github.com/grouzen/fflisp). Those were good times.  
- [Lecture Notes on Denotational Semantics by Glynn Winskel](/files/papers/denotational-semantics.pdf)  
  The topic is explained using [Domain theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_theory) as a basis to reason
  about denotational semantics.  
- [Monadic Parser Combinators (NOTTCS-TR-96-4)](/files/papers/monparsing.pdf)  
  I guess this is the most fascinating paper about this topic. After reading it you will understand
  what well-known abstractions were used and why, what the minimum set of combinators (operators) is needed
  to be able to write parsers of any complexity.

<i>I will be very grateful if you could advise me papers you ♥!</i>
