# Papers I ♥

<i>
On this page I'll store some papers which were usefull for me or gave me the unforgettable and exciting hours of reading them.

- [LISP 1.5 Programmer's manual](http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/129874/37a4142032912cebb0e8fe8f61c6fe2f.pdf?sequence=1)

    The most significant paper in the history of computer languages and CS. I've read this lovely peace of art many years ago, and the next day
    after that I've started to write [fflisp](https://github.com/grouzen/fflisp). Those were good times.
  
- [Lecture Notes on Denotational Semantics by Glynn Winskel](/files/papers/denotational-semantics.pdf)
  
    The topic is explained using [Domain theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_theory) as a basis to reason
    about denotational semantics.
  
- [Monadic Parser Combinators (NOTTCS-TR-96-4)](/files/papers/monparsing.pdf)
  
    I guess this is the most fascinating paper about this topic. After reading it you will understand
    what well-known abstractions were used and why, what the minimum set of combinators (operators) is needed
    to be able to write parsers of any complexity.
  
- [Natural Semantics](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2010/course/DAT140_Types/Kahn.pdf)  

    It's an introduction into Natural Semantics. Inside,
    authors creates a mini-ML compiler which compiles a mini-ML code into CAM (Categorical Abstract Machine) bytecode
    using Natural Semantics to reason about compiler, and CAM.
    

<i>I will be very grateful if you could advise me papers you ♥!</i>
