# Papers I ♥

<i>
On this page I'll store some papers which were usefull for me or gave me the unforgettable and exciting hours of reading them.
</i>

- [Lecture Notes on Denotational Semantics by Glynn Winskel](/files/papers/denotational-semantics.pdf)  
  The topic is explained using [Domain theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_theory) as a basis to reason
  about denotational semantics.  
- [Monadic Parser Combinators (NOTTCS-TR-96-4)](/files/papers/monparsing.pdf)  
  I guess this is the most fascinating paper about this topic. After reading it you will understand
  what well-known abstractions were used and why, what the minimum set of combinators (operators) is needed
  to be able to write parsers of any complexity.

<i>I will be very grateful if you could advise me papers you ♥!</i>
