# We&lambda;come there!

Hi, my name is Michael.

Currently, I'm a Perl programmer at GlobalLogic in Kyiv.
This blog is just my next attempt to start writing my thoughts 
and findings mostly about programming and computer science.

I'm just a self-taught who is interested  
in things like:

- *nix systems
- programming
- computer science and math
- music
- riding the bike.  

## Programming

For many years, my favorite text editor was Notepad.exe... 
just kidding, actually Emacs. One of my favorite programming language 
is by far the Common Lisp, and I think it will be so until my death.
Yeah, I know, you could say that there is no "type soundness" in it, but in my defense
I would say this blog is written in Haskell ;-).

#### My appeal to root_master@jabber.ru
