# We&lambda;come there!

Hi, my name is Michael.

Currently, I'm a Perl programmer at GlobalLogic in Kiev.  
Most of my time I'm sitting at the computer and trying to do
some cool stuff. Sometimes I can take my guitar to start playing
hard and fast like a beast.  

This blog is just my next attempt to start write some my thoughts 
and findings mostly about programming and computer science.

I'm not a professor, just a self-taught who is interested  
in things like:

- *nix systems
- programming
- computer science
- music
- and riding my bike.  

Looks pathetic, isn't it?

## Programming

For many years, my favorite text editor is Notepad.exe... 
just kidding, actually Emacs. One of my favorite programming language 
is by far the Common Lisp, and I think it will be so until my death.
Yeah, I know, you could say that it's not statically typed, but I really love
to write on it, so you can go away from here ;-).

## _To be continued..._
