    Here you can find some my thoughts about various things. I write them mostly in
    a spontaneous manner, so they could look funny and weird sometimes. Actually, I've been
    making this blog (in the true sense of the word 'blog') just to have an opportunity
    to look back into the past from the future (of course I need this just in order to laugh
    at myself ;).
